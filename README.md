# cellar3dredux
This is a 'clean shot' version of cellar3d which contains components of the microservices I developed to plug into the final version of cellar3d for go live. 
There will be additional functionality added during the dev process, which includes collating the microservices. 

Phase 1 of dev: DB structure, including apollo server and graphql.
Phase 2 of dev: working on query strucuture including metrics and all CRUD operations
Phase 3 of dev: working on front end.

Projected go-live: late 1q/early 2q 2023
